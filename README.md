Single-cell Amalgamation by Latent Semantic Analysis (SALSA)
============================================================

This R package provides methods described in Lozoya et al <https://doi.org/10.1101/551762>.

SALSA is an integrative and systematic methodology that introduces matrix focusing, a parametric frequentist approach to identify fractions of statistically significant and robust data within single-cell expression matrices.

The R package also provides R-shiny SALSA, a web interface for components of the single cell analysis workflow.
